// Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions


In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}



practice :

Create a function called reusableFunction which prints the string Hi World to the dev console.
Call the function.
