In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).
                                                                                 
  myVariable = 5;
                                                                                 
This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.


var myVar;   // declare
myVar = 5;   // Initializing  varaible or storing variable with the help of assignment operator  
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:
var myVar; 
                                                                                 
But you can also declare a string variable like this:
var myName = "your name";
                                                                                 
                                                           
Exercise :
    Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.
    Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.
    Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.
