Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

Example

const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
ourArray[0] = 15;

ourArray now has the value [15, 40, 30].


practice:

const myArray = [18, 64, 99];
Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.
