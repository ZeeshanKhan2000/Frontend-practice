In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. 
It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

I teach the camelCase naming convention in variable. Why "camelCase"? Because It'll make your variable names more readable, and you'll be less
likely to get variable names mixed up.


Examples :


// Best practice 

  var userResponse;
  var userResponseTime; 
  var userResponseTimeLimit;


// Bad practice

  var userresponse;
  var userresponsetime; 
  var userresponsetimeLlmit;
