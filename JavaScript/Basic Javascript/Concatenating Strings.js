// Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, 
it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.
Example
const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";


// Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. 
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.
Example:
let ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";


// Constructing Strings with Variables

const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";


exam :
Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings My name is and and I am well!
